# Student Information Tracking System
The system stores student information on a cloud based database from which the data can be remotely accessed or edited using a java based client.

## Project Description
A comprehensive solution for schools to track classes, instructor, and student information. Includes a Java platform independent application for the management of all critical facets of educational institutional operations, ensuring streamlined workflows and improved productivity. The main features are as follows:
- Create/Edit subjects with scheduled sections
- Add/Edit instructors and students
- Assign instructors to sections
- Instructors can create custom marked items for each section
- Enrol students in class sections
- Automatic performance reports are generated for sections, students, and instructors

### - Functional Diagram

The functional goal of the system is to allow users to access and edit student data at which point the data are validated and transferred to a secure storage medium. From there the data should be accessible for real-time analysis.

### - System Overview
![System Overview.png](System%20Overview.png)
The system consists of java based client running on a workstation, and a database used as data storage medium which is accessed through internet or LAN for editing or analysis purposes by various users with defined privileges.
